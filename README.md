# HomeKit-DIY-Kits
Concrete DIY Kits for Apple HomeKit. Includes Software and Hardware instructables.

When I got into Home Automation, I was drowning in different options and solutions that solved my problems only 90% or were of low quality.

Goal of this Repository is to provide complete and specific instructions to build concrete Home Automation IoT devices. Instead of being generic, these devices will be purpose-built and optimized and I will add specific guidance on HW components etc. I will also address which shortcomings each of the devices will try to address

The software integration will be mostly based on HAP-NodeJS, a really great project and effort.

Hardware will usually be based on the Raspberry Zero W as it seems to provide the lowest price point.

A Ready-to-use devices:


-None yet ;-)


B Currently developed devices:

1) Garage Door Opener

- Works with Open/Close Sensors for verification and to prevent odd states
- Support Garage Door openers with Stop-Reverse logic
- Will include obstacle detection

2) High Quality streaming Camera

The cameras I found so far were all inferior in streaming quality to the Logitech Circle 2. Since the lens quality is on par with the commercial camera I bought, I will try to solve the quality loss that is happening when streaming. I hope I won;t find out that Apple is reducing the quality for non-certfied devices.


C Planned devices:

3) Combine all these devices into a cheap generic one that can be placed into every room
4) Motion camera that is more flexible with how it stores snapshots (S3, ftp, ...)
5) Motion camera that uses a motion sensor instead of optical recognition
6) Temperatur and Humidity Sensor
7) Motion Sensor
8) Hybrid device
